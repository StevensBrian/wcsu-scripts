# wcsu-scripts

There are two scripts in this repository that, together, allow arclight to automatically detect changes to EADs and re-index them.

## monitorEADsForChanges.sh
The first script is monitorEADsForChanges.sh . It does what it says on the tin--it monitors the EADs directory for changes, then saves those changes to the file arclight_fileChanges.txt .
